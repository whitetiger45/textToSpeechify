#   this program simply reads an input file containing urls, 
#   uses the command line utility wget to download that resource, 
#   and then dispatches textToSpeechify.py on the downloaded blob.
#   only the text of the blog articles will be written to the output
#   file. 
# note:
#   this is a stable, dirty version of what is a work in progress; 
#   as more files are consumed, it will be improved.
