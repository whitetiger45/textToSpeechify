Release: 4.1.6
Date: 2022.09.14

Changes:
    2022.09.14:
        - Patched a dirty file bug (textToSpeechifyDispatcher) discovered as a result of the work of LiveOverflow. In his video Discovering Vulnerabilities in Intel CPU's (https://youtu.be/x_R1DeZxGc0) he cites the research papers [1] Foreshadow: Extracting the Keys to the Intel {SGX} Kingdom with Transient {Out-of-Order} Execution (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-van_bulck.pdf) and [2] SPECULOSE: Analyzing the Security Implications of Speculative Execution in CPUs (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04084.pdf), which led to the realization that files no longer in the urlFeed were getting written to the final output.
